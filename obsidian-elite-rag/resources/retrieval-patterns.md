# Retrieval Patterns and Strategies

## Retrieval Layer Patterns

### Semantic Retrieval Patterns

#### Vector Similarity Search
```
Pattern: Dense Vector Retrieval
Use Case: Find conceptually similar content
Strategy: Embed documents and queries in high-dimensional space
Implementation: Cosine similarity, dot product, or Euclidean distance
Optimization: Use approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) algorithms
Example: "Find documents similar to machine learning concepts"
```

#### Hybrid Semantic Search
```
Pattern: Combine semantic with keyword matching
Use Case: Balance conceptual similarity with exact term matching
Strategy: Weighted combination of vector similarity and BM25/TF-IDF
Implementation: Elasticsearch with dense vectors, or custom scoring
Optimization: Tune weighting based on domain and use case
Example: "Find Python code mentioning 'async' and related to performance"
```

#### Cross-Encoder Reranking
```
Pattern: Two-stage retrieval with neural reranking
Use Case: Improve precision of semantic search results
Strategy: Initial retrieval with bi-encoder, rerank with cross-encoder
Implementation: BERT-based cross-encoder for final ranking
Optimization: Limit reranking to top N candidates for efficiency
Example: "Most relevant research papers for specific query"
```

### Knowledge Graph Retrieval Patterns

#### Entity-Centric Retrieval
```
Pattern: Retrieve based on entity relationships
Use Case: Find content related to specific entities

Example: "Find connections between 'Docker' and 'CI/CD' through tools"
```

#### Graph Context Expansion
```
Pattern: Expand query context using graph neighbors
Use Case: Enrich query with related concepts
Strategy: Extract entities, find neighbors, reconstruct query
Implementation: Entity extraction + graph traversal
Optimization: Filter neighbors by relevance and confidence
Example: "Expand 'REST API' to include HTTP, JSON, endpoints, and related patterns"
```

#### Temporal Graph Retrieval
```
Pattern: Time-aware knowledge graph queries
Use Case: Find relationships that change over time
Strategy: Include temporal metadata in graph nodes/edges
Implementation: Time-based filtering and ranking
Optimization: Index temporal metadata for efficient filtering
Example: "Recent developments in 'React' ecosystem"
```

### Temporal Retrieval Patterns

#### Recency-Based Retrieval
```
Pattern: Prioritize recent content
Use Case: Find current information and trends
Strategy: Weight documents by modification/creation date
Implementation: Decay functions or time-based filtering

Example: "Latest developments in AI research"
```

#### Temporal Context Queries
```
Pattern: Query within specific time ranges
Use Case: Historical research or trend analysis
Strategy: Filter and rank by temporal relevance
Implementation: Date range queries with temporal scoring
Optimization: Pre-index temporal metadata

```

#### Temporal Relationship Tracking
```
Pattern: Track evolution of concepts over time
Use Case: Understand how ideas and technologies evolved
Strategy: Version entities and relationships in knowledge graph
Implementation: Temporal graphs with effective dating
Optimization: Compress history for long-term trends
Example: "Evolution of 'React' from 2013 to present"
```

### Domain Specialization Patterns

#### Domain-Specific Embeddings
```
Pattern: Train embeddings on domain-specific corpus
Use Case: Improve retrieval in specialized domains
Strategy: Fine-tune language models on domain data
Implementation: Domain-adapted BERT or custom embeddings
Optimization: Balance domain specificity with general knowledge
Example: "Medical literature retrieval using clinical embeddings"
```

#### Domain Filtered Retrieval
```
Pattern: Filter results by domain metadata
Use Case: Restrict search to specific knowledge domains
Strategy: Use tags, categories, or metadata for filtering
Implementation: Pre-filtering or post-filtering with domain rules
Optimization: Index domain metadata for efficient filtering
Example: "Only retrieve from 'computer science' domain"
```

#### Expertise-Based Weighting
```
Pattern: Weight results by domain expertise level
Use Case: Prioritize authoritative sources in specific domains
Strategy: Combine relevance with expertise scores
Implementation: Multi-objective ranking with expertise weighting
Optimization: Precompute expertise scores for frequent queries
Example: "Prefer peer-reviewed papers for academic queries"
```

### Meta-Knowledge Retrieval Patterns

#### Query Understanding and Reformulation
```
Pattern: Analyze and reformulate user queries
Use Case: Handle ambiguous, complex, or poorly phrased queries
Strategy: NLP analysis, query expansion, intent detection
Implementation: Language models for query understanding
Optimization: Cache common reformulations
Example: "Transform 'how to make fast web' into 'web performance optimization'"
```

#### Retrieval Result Analysis
```
Pattern: Analyze patterns in retrieval results
Use Case: Identify gaps, biases, or quality issues
Strategy: Statistical analysis of result sets
Implementation: Result clustering, diversity analysis
Optimization: Precompute common patterns
Example: "Detect if results are too narrow or diverse enough"
```

#### Adaptive Retrieval Strategies
```
Pattern: Select retrieval strategy based on query characteristics
Use Case: Automatically choose best approach for different query types
Strategy: Query classification with strategy selection
Implementation: Machine learning classifier for strategy selection
Optimization: Learn from user feedback and performance metrics
