## Concept & Innovation

This project introduces the novel concept of **supervised bidirectional AI communication** between different AI models (Claude Code â†” Gemini) through the Model Context Protocol (MCP), with:

- User approval gates for complete oversight
- 1M token context window utilization 
- Free-tier operation through OpenRouter
- Production-ready implementation with comprehensive tooling

## Technical Implementation

The implementation leverages:
- **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** for seamless integration
- **OpenRouter API** for cost-effective Gemini access
- **Python/uv ecosystem** for modern development practices
- **Comprehensive documentation** and real-world examples
